eCommerce Transactions Dataset Analysis
Overview
This repository contains the code and results for the analysis of an eCommerce transactions dataset. The dataset consists of three files: Customers.csv, Products.csv, and Transactions.csv. The goal of the project is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), build a lookalike model for customer recommendations, and perform customer segmentation using clustering techniques.

Tasks Completed

Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Business Insights
Objective: Perform EDA on the provided dataset and derive business insights.
Deliverables:
Python script (Sheshu_Enabothula_EDA.ipynb) containing the EDA code.
PDF report (Sheshu_Enabothula_EDA.pdf) with business insights.


Task 2: Lookalike Model
Objective: Build a lookalike model that takes a user's information as input and recommends 3 similar customers based on their profile and transaction history.
Deliverables:
Python script (Sheshu_Enabothula_Lookalike.ipynb) explaining the development of the lookalike model.
CSV file (Sheshu_Enabothula_Lookalike.csv) containing the top 3 lookalikes with their similarity scores for the first 20 customers.


Task 3: Customer Segmentation / Clustering
Objective: Perform customer segmentation using clustering techniques, using both profile and transaction data.
Deliverables:
Python script (Sheshu_Enabothula_Clustering.ipynb) containing the clustering code.
PDF report (Sheshu_Enabothula_Clustering.pdf) with the clustering results, including the number of clusters, DB Index value, and visualizations.
